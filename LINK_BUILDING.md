Link building & SEO plan (practical steps)

1) Technical SEO (first 7 days)
   - Ensure sitemap.xml is correct and submitted to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
   - Ensure pages return 200 and mobile-friendly. Fix any 4xx/5xx.
   - Add structured data for movies (extend JSON-LD per item).

2) Content & On-page
   - Create short landing posts for featured movies (unique descriptions) to avoid duplicate content.
   - Add an "About" and "Blog" page to publish news and SEO content targeting keywords (e.g., "stream movies online EU", "best tv shows 2026 US").

3) Outreach & Backlinks
   - Post promotional content to niche forums (movie fan sites), but respect their rules.
   - Publish social posts on Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram with OG images linking to landing.
   - Exchange guest posts with related blogs, providing unique writeups and linking back.

4) Localize for target markets
   - Provide pages and metadata oriented to EU, AU, US (English copy but mention region availability).
   - Use hreflang if you make multiple language/region pages.

5) Track & Iterate
   - Use Google Analytics and Search Console to see incoming queries and index status.
   - Improve pages with highest impressions but low clicks (better meta titles/descriptions).

Notes on backlinks:
- Quality over quantity: prefer a few high-quality sites (news sites, industry blogs).
- Avoid spammy link networks; that harms SEO.
